### Notes

 * Currently, everytime you make a change to the link in localstorage.js, you would need to rebuild by doing `npm run build` , and then run dev again.

 * Need to create a save/post request on each click of a repo item. Or, keep it as a post request every second, to optimize calls to the DB.

 * Need to create a get request on first load of page.

 * Unrelated to this repo, but need to figure out where/.how to host the server ; (whatsapp-poppin server repo)

 * toDO : check Im getting correct body in backend from each req (find req.body). Then get that to insert intop the DB.
